# Wordkitchen

Wordkitchen is a project that aims to build a site for people to freely publish articles.

## Technologies

The project runs on the `merng` stack i.e:

- Mongo DB
- Express
- React
- Node Js
- GraphQl

## Setup

### Backend

```bash
  cd wordkitchen-backend
  yarn install
  yarn start
```

### Frontend

  cd wordkitchen-frontend
  yarn install
  yarn start
```

## Progress

Currently the project has implemented the following features:

- Implementing a Rich Text Editor based on `draft-js`.
- Saving article to db.

The project is still far from complete. There are still plenty of features to implement. Feel free to clone the project and code along. I would love to see what you come up with.
